1 - Introduction
================

  This class handles all file operations. It presents several methods for manipulating the file system. The methods are in Portuguese

2 - What's new
==============

      - No new feature


3 - Corrected bugs
==================

  Corrected in Version 2.0 :
    - Corrected : During an extraction, if a call-back fucntion is used and try to skip
                  a file, all the extraction process is stopped. 

  Corrected in Version 1.3 :
    - Corrected : Support of static synopsis for method extract() is broken.
    - Corrected : invalid size of archive content field (0xFF) should be (0xFFFF).
    - Corrected : When an extract is done with a remove_path parameter, the entry for
      the directory with exactly the same path is not skipped/filtered.
    - Corrected : extractByIndex() and deleteByIndex() were not managing index in the
      right way. For example indexes '1,3-5,11' will only extract files 1 and 11. This
      is due to a sort of the index resulting table that puts 11 before 3-5 (sort on
      string and not interger). The sort is temporarilly removed, this means that
      you must provide a sorted list of index ranges.

  Corrected in Version 1.2 :

    - Nothing.

  Corrected in Version 1.1.2 :

    - Corrected : Winzip is unable to delete or add new files in a PclZip created archives.

  Corrected in Version 1.1.1 :

    - Corrected : When archived file is not compressed (0% compression), the
      extract method fails.

  Corrected in Version 1.1 :

    - Corrected : Adding a complete tree of folder may result in a bad archive
      creation.

  Corrected in Version 1.0.1 :

    - Corrected : Error while compressing files greater than PCLZIP_READ_BLOCK_SIZE (default=1024).


4 - Known bugs or limitations
=============================

  Please publish bugs reports in SourceForge :
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=40254&atid=427564

  In Version 2.x :
    - PclZip does only support file uncompressed or compressed with deflate (compression method 8)
    - PclZip does not support password protected zip archive
    - Some concern were seen when changing mtime of a file while archiving. 
      Seems to be linked to Daylight Saving Time (PclTest_changing_mtime).

  In Version 1.2 :

    - merge() methods does not check for duplicate files or last date of modifications.

  In Version 1.1 :

    - Limitation : Using 'extract' fields in the file header in the zip archive is not supported.
    - WinZip is unable to delete a single file in a PclZip created archive. It is also unable to
      add a file in a PclZip created archive. (Corrected in v.1.2)

  In Version 1.0.1 :

    - Adding a complete tree of folder may result in a bad archive
      creation. (Corrected in V.1.1).
    - Path given to methods must be in the unix format (/) and not the Windows format (\).
      Workaround : Use only / directory separators.
    - PclZip is using temporary files that are sometime the name of the file with a .tmp or .gz
      added suffix. Files with these names may already exist and may be overwritten.
      Workaround : none.
    - PclZip does not check if the zlib extension is present. If it is absent, the zip
      file is not created and the lib abort without warning.
      Workaround : enable the zlib extension on the php install

  In Version 1.0 :

    - Error while compressing files greater than PCLZIP_READ_BLOCK_SIZE (default=1024).
      (Corrected in v.1.0.1)
    - Limitation : Multi-disk zip archive are not supported.
